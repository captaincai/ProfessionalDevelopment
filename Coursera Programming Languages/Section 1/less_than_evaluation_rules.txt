3 steps:

1. What is the syntax?
  if a < b then x else y
  where (if, then, else) are keywords
  and a, b , x , y are subexpressions
2. What are the type checking rules:
  a and b must be the same type and result is boolean
  x and y must be the same type, but can be any type
3. What is the evaluation:
  evaluate a < b
  if true then x is the result
  else y is the result
